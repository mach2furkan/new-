Welcome to the **Smart Home Automation System**, a powerful simulation of a home automation environment written in **C++**. This project integrates modern C++ features such as multithreading, networking, object-oriented programming, and more to create a fully functional smart home system.

---

## üåü **Features**

This project is packed with advanced features to simulate a real-world smart home environment:

### Core Features
- **Device Management**: Add, remove, and modify devices like lights, thermostats, security cameras, and smart locks.
- **Scheduling**: Schedule tasks like turning on lights or adjusting thermostat temperatures.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Simulate real-time updates using multithreading.
- **User Authentication**: Secure login with roles (admin, guest, maintenance).
- **Networking**: Simulate communication between devices using sockets.

### Advanced Features
- **Energy Consumption Tracker**: Track energy usage for all devices.
- **Dynamic Device Creation**: Add devices dynamically during runtime.
- **Weather Integration**: Simulate weather updates for the thermostat.
- **Smart Speaker**: Play music and respond to voice commands.
- **Maintenance Alerts**: Notify users when devices require maintenance.
- **Customizable Device Names**: Rename devices dynamically.
- **Energy-Saving Mode**: Automatically reduce energy consumption by turning off non-essential devices.
- **Event Logging with Timestamps**: Log all actions with timestamps for better traceability.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è **Technologies Used**

- **Programming Language**: C++17
- **Multithreading**: `std::thread` for real-time updates.
- **Networking**: Sockets for device communication.
- **Logging**: Persistent logs with timestamps.
- **Object-Oriented Design**: Modular classes for devices, users, scheduler, etc.
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling for invalid inputs and network failures.

## üöÄ **Getting Started**

### Prerequisites

- **C++ Compiler**: Ensure you have a C++ compiler that supports C++17 (e.g., GCC, Clang).
- **Git**: Install Git to clone the repository.
- **Optional**: Boost.Asio for advanced networking (not required for basic functionality).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mach2furkan/new-.git
   cd new-
   ```

2. Compile the project:
   ```bash
   g++ -std=c++17 -pthread -o smart_home main.cpp
   ```

3. Run the executable:
   ```bash
   ./smart_home
   ```

## üìö **Project Structure**

The project is organized into modular components:

- **Devices**: Classes for managing lights, thermostats, security cameras, and smart locks.
- **Scheduler**: Handles timed tasks like turning on/off devices.
- **User Authentication**: Implements secure login with roles and permissions.
- **Networking**: Simulates communication between devices using sockets.
- **Logging**: Logs all actions with timestamps for debugging and auditing.
- **Energy Tracker**: Tracks energy consumption across devices.
